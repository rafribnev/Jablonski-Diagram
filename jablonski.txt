STEPS TO CREATE A JABLONSKI DIAGRAM:
1) Edit jablonski.dat: 
    Write energies in the table. S0t is left at 0 by definition and the program is built for inputs in Hartree unit.
    If another unit is used on the input, change the conversion factor (conv) to 1.
    Don't edit  the columns labeled as "X".
    
2) Edit jablonski.gp:
    Change the title and the y axis label as you like.
    Edit the variables like the following: 
                                            conv is the conversion factor, some are displayed above for you to copy.
                                            s1c is the S1_cis energy.
                                            s1t is the S1_trans energy.
                                            t1 is the triplet state energy. 
                                            deltae is the energy difference between cis and trans. 
                                            
   These energies will also be printed out in the png output with the unit conversion you're using.
   If you want this disabled, comment the lines 49 to 52 (using # at the beginning of the line). 
                                            
                                            
3) Open terminal (Linux) or your application exe (Windows) and write "gnuplot jablonski.gp" on the same directory as both your files (jablonski.dat and jablonski.gp)

4) Your diagram should be created in the same directory as before. DONE.
